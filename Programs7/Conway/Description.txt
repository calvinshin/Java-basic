For my assignment I took the Conway Cell and made the following modifications to create MultiStateCell:
- Changed the logic for how many neighbors meant that a cell would be alive (2-3 to 1-3)
- Inserted a new state after death that inhibited growth for one round
-- This is done through a class called SleeperCell that effectively inhibits growth for the next round, changing the behavior of cell propagation.
When using both of these changes combined, the blinker begins to create a pattern in the middle and expands out infinitely.

To execute the program, run java ConwayMain. The BlinkerCell is currently inside the program, which will affect how MultiStateCell propogates.
BlinkerCell will switch between being alive and dead in alternating rounds.
Because this cell has no propgation logic, it simply switches between two states and does not directly influence the cells around it.
